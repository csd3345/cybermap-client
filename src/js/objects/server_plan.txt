1. Attacks are stored in a file OR auto-generated
2. 2 Paths can be followed
    a. If the file method is used then attacks have a limit
    b. If the auto-generation method is used then there is no limit
3. In both cases redis publishing interval is not impacted but the file
   limit will invoke a repeat
4. The statistics must display data in the past 24 hours.
    When using auto-generated data we have to update the statistics every second, but the same thing implies
    for the file method.
